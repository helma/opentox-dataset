OpenTox Datasets
=================

* An OpenTox REST Webservice
* Stores associations between compounds and features in datasets
* Implements a subset of the OpenTox dataset API (http://opentox.org/wiki/opentox/Dataset).
* Current version runs at http://webservices.in-silico.ch/dataset/v0

EXAMPLES

Create a dataset from a csv file:

  curl -X POST -F name="Hamster carcinogenicity" -F file=@hamster_carcinogenicity.csv  http://webservices.in-silico.ch/dataset/v0/

  returns a {dataset_uri}

Show a list of all compounds:

  curl {dataset_uri}/compounds

Show a list of all features:

  curl {dataset_uri}/features

Show all compounds and their features:

  curl {dataset_uri}/compounds/features
